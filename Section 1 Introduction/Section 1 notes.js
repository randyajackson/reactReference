/**
 * What is react?
 * Javascript library for building User Interfaces.
 * 
 * Components are used for creating user interfaces
 * 
 * Code is more manageable (header, headline, sidebar, article content)
 * 
 * You code elements (like functions) with html and call them seperately.
 * 
 * UI state becomes difficult to handle with vanilla javascript
 * 
 * Two kinds of applications:
 * single page application
 * only one html page, content is rendered on client
 * every component is a react component
 * Typically only one ReactDOM.render() call
 * 
 * multiple page applications
 * multiple html pages, content is rendered on server
 * some can be react, some arent
 * One ReactDOM.render() call per widget
 *
